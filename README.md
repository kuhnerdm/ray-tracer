# ray-tracer
A simple ray tracer with Phong shading and BVH scene traversal written in C++

This repo contains the code for a ray tracer that takes an obj scene file and a mtl material file and outputs a png with the scene rendered with Phong shading and reflections.

This project was completed in CSSE451 - Advanced Computer Graphics at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.

Note: The code contained in GenVector.h, obj_parser.h, objLoader.hpp, and simplePNG.h was provided before starting the project.
